1. Find a firmware with mesh bed leveling enabled
2. Install on your computer Arduino IDE (https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software)
3. Connect your computer to printer via USB
4. Flash new firmware
5. Prepare test print object made of small circles (6-10mm) placed at mesh points (I use 5x5 mesh so it gives 25 circles).  Make circles height of 0.3mm
6. Slice circles object the way so first layer is also 0.3mm
7. Print circles
8. Measure circles with scale. If to thick, it means that your Z axis at given mesh point is to high, if too thin it means that your Z axis is too low. If about 0.3-0.32mm then it is ok. Best write it down in some spreadsheet file and compare results from different prints
9. Based on measurement results prepare G-codes (M421)
10. Run that G-code
11. Save leveling mesh to printers eeprom
12. Enable mesh before print - best in starting script - with M420 S1 G-Code


All necesarry things (especially, spreadsheet example, firmware, g-codes, stl) you should find in this repo, so you don't have to go through all steps of this instruction manually.
